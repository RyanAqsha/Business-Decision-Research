# Customer Transaction Behavior Analysis

This project aims to analyze customer transaction behavior using historical transaction data. The analysis includes identifying patterns based on the year of first transaction, transaction frequency, and average transaction amount. The goal is to generate insights that can support product strategy and customer segmentation.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset contains:
- Year of first transaction
- Total and average transaction amount
- Product type
- Transaction frequency

> Note: The dataset used in this project is anonymized and used for educational purposes only.

## ðŸ›  Tools and Libraries
